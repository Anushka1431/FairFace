# FairFace
Bias Evaluation in Face Classification using FairFace Dataset and FaceNet

In this project I have trained a FaceNet-based classification model to predict race and evaluate its performance across multiple demographic groups. Through detailed analysis, I've assesed the fairness of the model using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC curves. By measuring false positive rates (FPR), false negative rates (FNR), and other fairness indicators, I aim to quantify racial disparities in the modelâ€™s predictions.
The findings from this study are crucial in understanding and mitigating bias in face recognition systems.
